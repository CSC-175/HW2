// Write a program that will prompt the user for an 
// integer n that will be tested to determine if it 
// is a prime number. Use a for loop to repeatedly test the 
// integer n to see if an i = 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . etc. up to n-1, 
// is a divisor of the integer. If you find a number that 
// divides n evenly then you have proven that the number is not prime.
// When a divisor is found to prove that the integer n is not prime, 
// then output the smallest number that divides the integer n.  
// If all possibilities are exhausted and no divisor was found that 
// evenly divides integer n then the number must be prime.
// Your program should handle input errors caused by invalid data entered by the user. 
// The program should also check with the user to see if they wish to test another number. 
// If yes, then prompt the user for the number to test. If they answer no then the program should terminate.Â
